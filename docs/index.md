!!! info "Welcome to the new Wiki of Wavelog!"
    25th Februrary 2026  
    This wiki is currently under construction (and probably will be forever). We are working hard to fill it with useful information and guides. We know that there are a lot of outdated pages from the old wiki. Updating and rewriting them is a huge task, but we are doing our best to get it done as soon as possible. If you want to help us with this, please feel free to contribute. You can find more information about how to contribute in the <a href="project/contributing#documentation-guidelines">Contributing</a> page. Thank you for your patience and support!

## What is Wavelog?

Wavelog is your new primary logbook — self-hosted, multi-user ready and accessible from anywhere with any browser. It serves as a central hub for all your QSOs and lets you distribute them from a single platform to third-party QSL services.

Beyond basic logging, Wavelog offers a rich feature set: permission management for club stations, powerful analytics, maps for worked entities (DXCC, Grid, States and more) and APIs for third-party tool integration. It includes full QSL management with label printing, advanced SAT tools for tracking and logging, award checking based on your logged QSOs and widgets and maps you can embed on your own homepage. A built-in callbook lookup rounds out the package — with many more features besides.

## What is it not?

Wavelog is not a QSL service and it's not a QSO dumpster. It's not a backup destination for your logs, nor a service that automatically imports QSOs from QRZ, LoTW, or eQSL that aren't already in your own log. It is, at its core, *your* logbook.

## Technology

Wavelog sits on top of a web server, commonly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29" target="_blank">LAMP Stack</a> which includes the  

**L** inux operating system along with the  
**A** pache web server,  
**M** ySQL relational database and the  
**P** HP language. 

On the application side, Wavelog is built on <a href="https://codeigniter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeIgniter 3</a> as its PHP framework, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> for the responsive UI and <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jQuery</a> for client-side interactivity. While CodeIgniter 3 is a mature framework, it has proven to be a solid and reliable foundation for Wavelog. A migration to CodeIgniter 4 is not on the current roadmap.

Please note that hosting Wavelog requires a minimum understanding of LAMP and troubleshooting errors. Without this knowledge, users may find it challenging to manage the interface and connected services.

    Für deutsche Nutzer steht ein praxisorientiertes Handbuch von DG9VH zur Verfügung: <a href="https://wiki.dg9vh.de/wavelog_nutzerhandbuch:start" target="_blank">Zum Handbuch</a> Dies ist im Rahmen der DARC Instanz von Wavelog entstanden und wird ständig aktualisiert.

## History

The work on this project started at the end of 2023 as a spin-off of the well-known amateur radio software Cloudlog. The four core developers – DF2ET, DJ7NT, HB9HIL and LA8AJA – who have pushed Cloudlog forward for months and years, decided to continue their work in a fork that led to Wavelog. Since its initial release on February 1, 2024, Wavelog has made tremendous progress in terms of stability and functionality. We are proud that Wavelog is developed by radio amateurs for radio amateurs, without commercial motives, but out of pure passion for the hobby. Every line of code is the result of hard work to continuously improve this piece of great code. Wavelog is known for its simplicity, powerful tools and open-source code. As a web application, Wavelog offers the great advantage of being accessible from anywhere in the world. Whether on a professional server, rented webspace or a RaspberryPi at home, Wavelog makes it possible to manage your logbook anytime, anywhere. Try it yourself and experience improved web-based logging on your server.
