# Update Country Files

You can use Update Country Files to update the DXCC lookup information that is used for callsign information, this data is provided by [Clublog](https://clublog.org)

* The **Update** button downloads the latest files from Clublog. It might be necessary to start this process several times, in the case the download gets interrupted. A successful download of the country files has been carried out only when the status information looks like the following:  
`DONE`  
`Dxcc Entities: 402`  
`Dxcc Exceptions: 29047`  
`Dxcc Prefixes: 4119`  
The `DONE` in the first line is important!
* Check missing DXCC / Countries values
* Re-Check ALL - This checks your whole log and makes sure it's correct.
