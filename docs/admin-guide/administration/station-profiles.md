Station Profiles are used to contain QSOs within a profile, this will be the callsign used, DXCC, Gridsquare or even SOTA reference, if you have a fresh install of Wavelog you must create a profile and set it as active if you have QSOs already but they aren't showing run `index.php/station/assign_all`

## Buttons

* Empty Log - Deletes all the QSOs contained within the station profile
