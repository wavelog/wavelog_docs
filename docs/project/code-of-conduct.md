# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors and maintainers of Wavelog pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive and healthy community.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information — such as a physical or email address — without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — GitHub repositories, issue trackers, discussion forums and any other official channels. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers via the contact information on [www.wavelog.org](https://www.wavelog.org). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these guidelines when determining consequences:

**1. Correction**
A private written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

**2. Warning**
A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time.

**3. Temporary Ban**
A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period.

**4. Permanent Ban**
A permanent ban from any public interaction within the community.
