# Analytics

The Analytics dropdown has the following options:

* Statistics provides info on QSO per year, mode and band, plus a list of satellites used.
* Gridsquares can be viewed by band or satellites, the map starts at the high level and zooms through the sub and extended squares.
* Distances worked are selected by band or satellites (not individual sats) and are displayed in a graph of distance against number of QSOs with callsigns listed at each range. Number of contacts and the detail of the furthest contact are also provided.
* Days with QSOs are broken down by year and number of days then plotted in a graph.
* DXCC Timeline shows DXCC contacts by date and prefix with a link to the details of the contact.
* Accumulated statistics is used to see the accumulated number of DXCC, WAS, WAZ or IOTA that has been worked in your log. This can be filtered on band and/or mode. You can also choose to see it on a yearly basis or monthly basis. Depending on the size and filters, it can take a while to get a result.
* Timeplotter is useful to analyze your own log to see when a dxcc or cq zone has been worked on a certain band. This can be useful to look for openings to certain parts of the world on a certain band.
