# Themes

Wavelog supports theming, and several themes are included in the release.
To set a theme, you must edit your user account and set the theme there.

To set a public theme, you need to go to admin and global options. Set your wanted theme under appearance. A public theme is the default theme for all users, but it can be readjusted individually by every user (see above). User specific themes show effectiveness after logon only.

If you want to make your own theme, make a folder under assets/css, and place the edited files there (bootstrap.min.css and overrides.css).
To add this as a selection in Wavelog, go to options and themes. Add the theme name and the folder name there. Your own theme should now be available to choose.
