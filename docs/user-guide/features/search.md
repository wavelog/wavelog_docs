# Search

Search is a powerful tool, to look for calls in your database or in the connected systems like qrz.com or hamqth.com. 

Simply enter the call to look for in the search box and click on the search button. All matching entries of your logbook will be displayed. If there are no contacts available, but the call sign has an entry in qrz.com, these information are shown instead.

If you enter parts of the call, all calls of your logbook which match the part to look for are displayed.

A more sophisticated search is available with the "advanced search". The calls to be displayed are selected via a more or less selfexplaining GUI, which lets you use entries from the database via a dropdown menu. After selecting a keyword, you need to enter a value and how to compare it.

After testing the new query, you have the option to save it for later use.

The button "edit queries" lets you alter already stored queries.
