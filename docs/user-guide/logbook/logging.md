# Logging

Clicking the QSO drop-down menu provides two options, **Live QSO** and **Post QSO**.

- Live QSO option has a real-time, per-second precision clock, and can also use information from the radio CAT interface to populate fields such as the frequency.
- Post QSO should be used to log contacts that don't need those fields mentioned above to be populated automatically.

After a callsign is entered, and the next field is selected, Wavelog will check qrz.com for details of the entered callsign and populate fields automatically with details if they are available.

## Previous contacts list

Below the map, the few previous contacts from your logbook are displayed. By default, last 5 contacts are displayed, but this number is configurable in the account settings.

### Date and time entry

While post-logging a QSO there is a shortcut for entering date and time: You can enter the date as "202109902" and it is automatically re-formatted to be "2021-09-02". Same goes for time. You can enter the time as "1413" and it is re-formatted to "14:13".

### RST - Readability Signal Tone

**RST (S)** is the code sent by you to your contact.
**RST (R)** is the code received by you from your contact.

For more information, please refer to the [R-S-T system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-S-T_system) Wikipedia page.

### Satellite tab

The satellite tab enables satellite name and mode to be entered from drop down menus, this also populates the frequency, band and mode fields in the QSO tab.

### General tab

The general tab allows to add additional information like IOTA or SOTA reference or Sig and Sig Info for WWFF or POTA contacts.

### Edit a QSO

You'll want to edit a qso for a number of reasons like adding grid-square, or updating the QSLing information. This is possible by going to the "Logbook" section then clicking the icon on the right hand side of each QSO.
